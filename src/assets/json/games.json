Scripted the moment-to-moment gameplay interactions, worked with engineers for engine support, and collaborated with artists to get models, set dressing, and animations. Authored event locations and worked alongside teammates to test, iterate, and tune to give players an exploratory-but-satisfying experience.",

        "description": "Created random encounters for players to discover in RDO's open world. This involved scripting events to react to multiple players, handle any way players might approach it, and setting up events to spawn at engaging rates. The event in the video, Suspension Trap, is all-new for Multiplayer, which involved collaborating with artists for the NPCs, engine coders for the rope hang functionality, and the writing team for the dialogue.",
