This involved prototyping various input methods, dictating spawn rates to balance levels, and building a system that could dynamically scale the grid size. I also worked on the powerup system and the tutorial systems.",

A VR player takes on the role of a giant painting machine, while the other uses a gamepad to control a glider. \n I programmed and designed the ship character controller, implemented the 2D UI systems, and crafted spawning systems for the powerups and VR helper minions",
